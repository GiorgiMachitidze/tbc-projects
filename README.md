      This project is about to create log in form which gives user ability to enter username and password, if it is correct then user goes to new page which tels us
 that authorization is succesful, else there appear on the same page error message which tells user to try again. We create login form with labels for username and password,
 also we create labels for "sign up" and "forget password", checkbox for show/hide password and sign in pushbutton. After click on it if username and password is correct
 user goes to another page else he/she have to try again.
